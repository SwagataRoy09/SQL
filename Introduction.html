<h1> Database</h1>
A database is a systematic collection of data.
There are many types of database, some of them are listed below :<br> 
<ol>
<li><u><b>Relational Database :</u></b>
<br>A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table where the data points are related to each other.<br>
Example of Relational Database are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, AzureSQL
<li><b><u>Non Relational Database : </u></b>
    </li></ol>
<br>
Non Relational Database is also known as NoSQL. NoSQLis very flexible unlike traditional relational databases, which use structured tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases can store data in various formats, such as:

- **Documents:** These are often JSON or BSON objects, where each document is a self-contained unit of data that can include complex nested structures. This makes it easy to store and query data with varied formats. MongoDB is a well-known example of a document-based NoSQL database.

- **Key-Value Stores:** Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs. This model is very simple and fast, making it ideal for caching and session management. Redis and DynamoDB are examples of key-value stores.

- **Column-Family Stores:** Data is stored in columns rather than rows, which can be more efficient for certain types of queries and large-scale data processing. Apache Cassandra and HBase are examples of column-family stores.

- **Graph Databases:** These are designed to represent and query relationships between data points, making them ideal for use cases like social networks or recommendation engines. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

The flexibility of NoSQL databases allows them to handle diverse data types and structures, making them well-suited for scenarios where data schema evolves over time or where the relationships between data are complex. They often provide high scalability and performance for large volumes of data and high-velocity transactions.
